C++ Prog 2 Assignment 1:

Algorithm: Locate the 13 consecutive digit sequence that yields the greatest product of all digits.
Version 1.1 (GNU-Linux)

This code will read all digits in the input file ("data.txt"), and will save the results in an output file ("result.txt")

Results are the greatest product found, as well as the first sequence of 13 consecutive digits that yielded that product and its starting index in the file.

I used some of my generic GNU-Linux lib files.
They can be found in https://github.com/RMSabe/GNU-Linux_Lib/tree/main/v1.2
